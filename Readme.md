# Repeater Custom Fields using Custom Meta Box Wordpress Function

Using this fork as starting point to achive my goal on build a simple plugin without all the features I don't need from much more developedplugins like ACF plugin.
I've encapsulated the functions into classes to be more clear for myself. Although it's unfinished, but I hope it serves as a tutorial to develope a wordpress plugin at the sametime.

- Updating javascript by converting jQuery into vanilla js. Althogh Wordpress still using jQuery it's a matter of time it'll be uodated into js as well IMO.
- Adding assets directory to store our css file.
- Updating `class RepeaterMetaCallback` to work with JS.
