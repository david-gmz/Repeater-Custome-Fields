# Repeater Custom Fields using Custom Meta Box Wordpress Function

Using this fork as starting point to achive my goal on build a simple plugin without all the features I don't need from much more developedplugins like ACF plugin.
I've encapsulated the functions into classes to be more clear for myself. Although it's unfinished, but I hope it serves as a tutorial to develope a wordpress plugin at the sametime.
